	"CRUSADE":{
		"english":"The attack roll does not need to be successful in order to generate knock back.\n\nIf a Crusade team member's Energy Explosion attack is unsuccessful against a target, but doubles are rolled, then the Crusade ability will generate knock back only for the missed target. If a Crusade team member's Energy Explosion is successful against a target, but unsuccessful against an adjacent figure, Crusade's ability will also generate knock back against the adjacent figures."

If it has been carried this turn, you could not assign it a move action, as it is \"free\". It is not a free action, it is an action which is free from the perspective of your action pool (the number of actions you can assign on a turn).\n\nIf a character with this team ability is given a move action that requires break away, it may still use this ability. On a failed break away roll, it would still get a token and the action will not come from the action pool."

		"english":"If a character fails its roll while trying to become adjacent to the Hypertime team member, it may continue its move from the current position. If there are no legal squares in which the character that failed its roll against the Hypertime team ability may move, the character must end its movement in the first available legal square along the path it took when moving adjacent to the Hypertime team member, even if that square is the square in which the character began its movement.\n\nThis team ability only applies when a character goes from not being adjacent to a Hypertime character to becoming adjacent to a Hypertime character. If one is adjacent to a Hypertime character at the beginning of an action, for example, and rolls successfully for break away, then a Hypertime roll would not be necessary if the character moves and maintains adjacency to that Hypertime character.\n\nWhen attempting to move into adjacency with two or more opposing characters using this team ability, one roll is made.\n\nThe character attempting to move into adjacency is the character which makes the roll."

It can't use a team ability that another character is able to use (but does not possess).\n\nWhen using another team ability, a wild card team member is considered part of that team for team ability purposes; for everything else, it is a member of the team printed on its base.\n\nThe rule regarding using only one team ability per action refers only to the usage of the wild card team ability. If a character is a wild card and also is a member of another team, it can essentially use 2 team abilities as it can use its natural team ability as well as its wild card team ability.\n\nIf a character is a wild card in addition to another team ability, being a wild card does not affect their ability to use that other team ability in any way.\n\nWild cards can't use a team ability if they are already using an identical mechanic through another game effect."
