  "Breaking Away": {
    "english": "If a character occupying a square adjacent to one or more opposing characters is given an action and attempts to move, that character must successfully break away before it can move, as shown in Figure 8.

On a result of 3 or less, that character fails to break away and can't move; resolve the action immediately, including assigning that character any action tokens for that action. On a result of 4 or higher, that character succeeds in breaking away from all opposing characters adjacent to it. Regardless of any game effects, a d6 roll of 1 automatically results in a character failing to break away, while a d6 roll of 6 automatically results in a character succeeding in breaking away. Only one successful break away roll is required to move away from all adjacent opposing characters or other game effects that may require break away from that square. Once a character successfully breaks away, it can move through squares adjacent to every opposing character or game effect from which it broke away; but ends its movement as normal if it becomes adjacent to an opposing character that it did not break away from this action"
  },
  "Bystander tokens": {
    "english": "A bystander token is a character which does not have a combat dial. Although a bystander token has combat values and follows all rules for HeroClix characters, it does not click. If a bystander token takes any damage, it is defeated.\n\nHORDE TOKENS\nHorde tokens are bystander tokens marked with the |lotrm| symbol. Unlike other characters, identical horde tokens (those with the same set symbol and collector number) can share a single square on the battlefield by being stacked, and when stacked they can use special powers called horde powers. Many horde powers scale with the number of tokens in the stack.\n\nSTACKING AND UNSTACKING HORDE TOKENS\nTwo or more identical friendly horde tokens in the same square after actions resolve is a stack. A stack can contain up to the maximum number of horde tokens indicated on the token next to the |lotrm| symbol. Horde tokens may be stacked during their placement in the starting area at the beginning of the game during step 3 of Preparing for Battle. Horde tokens may only be stacked if they began the game on the same force. When a horde token or a stack enters a square occupied by an identical horde token/stack, you may choose to have the tokens merge into one stack. If a single horde token/stack merges into another stack, the action that caused the token/stack to move immediately ends and the stack is given the action token that the token/stack would have been given at the resolution of its action. Stacks that move through single horde tokens may continue their action normally.\nTwo stacks can also merge, but are still limited by the maximum stack size; any remaining tokens are placed in the last square the stack moved through before merging. When a single horde token joins or creates a stack, if the resulting stack is already marked with an action token (or two) do not place a token on the stack. Stacks break away normally; single horde tokens also need to break away when they are moving out of a stack.\nAs tokens and stacks merge into a single stack, any game effects with an ongoing duration that are affecting the token or stack are now affecting the stack. In the cases where this causes an illegal condition (e.g., holding two objects), the token or stack joining the stack has the game effect end as it joins the stack (e.g., the second object would be dropped).\nIf a stack has not yet been assigned an action token during a turn, an individual horde token in the stack may unstack. Give the horde token a move action to leave the stack and move away. When a token leaves a stack, any game effects affecting the stack no longer affect the token.\n\nSTACKS ON THE BATTLEFIELD\nA stack of horde tokens is considered a single character for all purposes. When a stack takes damage from an attack, regardless of the amount of damage taken, remove only one token from the stack. When any other damage is dealt to the stack, remove one token for each click of damage. The token removed from the stack is defeated. A stack of horde tokens has a point value equal to the total point value of all horde tokens in the stack. A stack can't be carried.\n\nHORDE POWERS\nHorde powers are explained on the back of horde tokens. When the |lotrs| symbol appears in the text of a horde power, it refers to the current number of tokens in the stack. When the |lotrm| symbol appears in the text of a horde power, it refers to the maximum number of tokens that stack can have. When the phrase \"When |lotrm|\" appears in the text of a horde power, it refers to a power than can only be used if the current number of tokens in the stack is the maximum allowed.\n\nEPIC HORDES\nIn epic battles, defeated horde tokens are removed from the battlefield as normal but have a chance to return. At the beginning of each player's turn, that player may place horde tokens previously removed from the battlefield back onto the battlefield in that player's starting area. For each 100 points of the game's build total, a player may return two horde tokens to the battlefield at the beginning of their turn, to a maximum of 50 total points of tokens per turn. You may return them directly into a stack if the stack is in that player's starting area and has less than |lotrm| tokens in the stack. In an epic battle, if a player has only horde tokens remaining on the battlefield at the end of any turn, all of their horde tokens are immediately defeated."

  "Multi-Based Characters": {
    "english": "FROM CORE RULEBOOK\nMost HeroClix characters are mounted on a base that takes up one square of the map; these are called single-base characters. A multi-base character is mounted on a base that takes up more than one square. A multi-base character occupies all of the squares each of its bases occupies and is adjacent to each square adjacent to the squares its bases occupies, as shown in Figure 15. Squares on opposite sides of a multibase character are not adjacent to each other.\nA multi-base character that occupies two bases is a peanut base. Peanut bases can be oriented in any two adjacent squares. A multibase character that occupies more than two squares is a larger base character. A larger base character is only allowed to be oriented horizontally or vertically; it can't be oriented diagonally. Multibase characters can't be carried or knocked back. They can't be placed by the Telekinesis power.\n\nMOVING MULTI-BASE CHARACTERS\nWhen a multi-base character moves, choose any square occupied by the multi-base character to begin the movement. The character moves as if it is a single base character moving from the chosen square and follows all movement rules accordingly. Multi-base characters must always end movement so that all of its bases occupy legal, adjacent squares. No part of the base may be moved more squares than the one chosen for the move. If any square a multi-base character occupies is hindering terrain, the character is considered to occupy hindering terrain when it begins to move, no matter which square it starts from.\n\nATTACKING AND MULTI-BASE CHARACTERS\nWhen attacking or drawing a line of fire to or from a multi-base character, the player attacking or drawing the line of fire can choose to attack or draw the line of fire to or from any one square occupied by the multi-base character. When attacking a character on the same elevation, a line of fire to another character will be blocked if it crosses any square occupied by a multi-base character. One square of a multi-base character will not block the line of fire from another square it occupies. When a multi-base character's attack or line of fire involves multiple targets, each target may have a line of fire drawn from a different square, as long as each square is one that the multi-base character occupies.\n\nFROM PLAYERS GUIDE\nIf multibase character can't fit within your starting area due to terrain features (Blocking terrain, changes in elevation, etc), you may extend your starting area so that the character will fit. If extending your starting area will not create the necessary space you may instead place the multibased character in your starting area and treat all squares it occupies as if they were clear terrain of the same elevation as long as the multibased character is not moved or placed into other squares. Once the multibased character no longer occupies those squares, they revert to their original terrain and elevation type.\n\nUnless otherwise directed, when a game effect directs you to place a multi-based character, place one square as you would any character, then place the rest of the base legally."

Once a force is considered a themed team, it remains a themed team until the end of the game, even if the characters on your force no longer meet the criteria of a themed team.\n\nTHEMED TEAM BENEFITS\nInitiative Bonus\nWhen rolling to establish who will be the first player, the player using a themed team gets a +1 bonus to the roll for each character possessing the shared keyword on that player's force.\n\nAdditional Team Abilities\nAdditional Team Ability (ATA) cards can be added to your force when it is a themed team. Each ATA card indicates the cost per character that must be added to your force in order to use it in the game; all characters that meet the prerequisites must be assigned the ATA and your force's build total is affected accordingly. ATA cards provide either different or additional team abilities to the qualifying characters on your force. These team abilities are possessed by the qualifying characters and can be used by wild cards (unless the ATA specifies otherwise). A force may only include one ATA card.\n\nTIP! Although ATA cards use a keyword as a prerequisite, it is not required that the themed team's shared keyword be the same keyword as the ATA!\n\nThemed Team Probability Control (TTPC)\nWhen your force is a named themed team, it can use TTPC. TTPC allows any character on a named themed team to use Probability Control. This use of Probability Control does not count towards any other game effects that reference the use of Probability Control (such as meeting prerequisites for feats). The number of times you may use TTPC during a game is equal to the number of characters on your force at the beginning of the game, up to 1 per 100 points of the game's build total. In addition, characters using TTPC:\n •\tMust possess the keyword that establishes the theme of the force.\n •\tMust not have already been given a non-free action this turn.\n •\tMust not be able to use Probability Control through another game effect.\n •\tMust not have used Probability Control in this way earlier in the turn. •\tMust immediately be given an action token (this does not affect your Action Total for the turn)."

  "Turns": {
    "english": "The \"beginning of turn\" ends with the first non-free action assigned to a character, unless that action specifically states that it can be given during the beginning of the turn.\n\nEffects that occur at the end of the turn may be performed in any order, but you may not give your figures actions after you have cleared tokens."

  "Walls": {
    "english": "All walls are assumed to stop exactly at the edges of squares. Even if it looks like a wall \"sticks out\" into a doorway, it doesn't, and thus diagonal attacks can pass through without being blocked. A square of blocking terrain on the opposite side of the wall does not block the line of fire to that square when targeting a wall with a ranged attack.\n\nIf blocking terrain exists on the opposite side of a wall, destroying the wall does not destroy the blocking terrain. Only place a debris marker on the side of the wall without the blocking terrain. A separate attack must be made to destroy the blocking terrain.\n\nWalls are blocking terrain for all game purposes except that (a) they are not considered a square of blocking terrain and (b) they are not included in an area of blocking terrain."

  "Wild Cards": {
    "english": "Wild card team abilities allow a character to use any team ability possessed by any friendly character on the battlefield. A character that possesses a wild card team ability is called a \"wild card\". Although wild cards can use team abilities, they do not possess the copied team ability nor do they possess the team symbol. Certain game effects only apply to characters that possess a particular team ability or symbol – wild cards would not qualify for these through using another character's team ability. Some team abilities are labeled as \"Uncopyable\". A wild card character can't use an uncopyable team ability from another character.\nA wild card may be given a free action to use a single team ability that a friendly character possesses. A wild card may be given this free action more than once per turn (this is an exception to the rule that characters can't activate the same free action more than once per turn). A wild card begins the game not using any other character's team ability. A wild card may change the team ability it is using to any team ability possessed by a friendly character (or no team ability) with each free action it is given.\n\nTIP! Many wild card teams use characters with lots of team abilities so that their wild card can change from one team ability to another throughout the game. Make sure you remember to give your wild cards a free action towards the end of your turn to make sure that they are copying the team ability you want them to have on your opponent's turn!\n\nA wild card retains its most recently used team ability until it is given a free action to use another team ability (or choose no team ability) or until after the resolution of an action during which all friendly characters whose team ability the wild card is using are defeated or removed from the battlefield. If a copied team ability includes a \"once per turn\" or \"once per game\" clause, a wild card follows that clause each time it uses the team ability as if it were using it consistently the entire game. A wild card activating Pulse Wave can continue to use a copied team ability even if the team abilities of the friendly characters are being ignored."
